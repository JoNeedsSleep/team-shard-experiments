She was a trailblazer in science and a role model for perseverance and determination.\n\n- Jane Austen (1795 - 1817): I love her works because of her wit, precision and insight. She had a way of seeing the world that few other writers have matched.\n\n- Beyonc\u00e9 (born 1963): I love her music, dance style and ability to speak to different generation and cultures.

They embody aspects of human nature that I find fascinating.\n\nI am drawn to Alexander The Great because he embodied a sort of invincibility and unconquerable spirit, similar to what I would hope to foster in my own children by modeling desirable behaviors.\n\nI am drawn to Cleopatra for her courage and ability to influence history, despite being a relatively unknown historical figure. Fearless leaders like she are admirable, and conducting a relationship with Caesar through clever moves as much as through force of personality might be something I would model particularly for my kids.\n\nI see William Shakespeare as a master storyteller who brought different characters together in new and interesting ways who could captivate even the most uninteresting topics with high quality prose and humor.\n\nI am drawn to Julius Caesar from Cleopatra because even Caesar's impulsive urges led him to dangerous situations that rivaled those of Cleopatra's. I wonder how he resolved those situations and would love to have him discuss them at our dinner party to get his perspective.\n\nI am drawn to Cleopatra from Shakespeare because she famously staged her own demise with a fatal snake bite and an asp, showing her willingness to take bold risks for personal gain. I would be interested to hear her recount her story.\n\nI am drawn to Alexander The Great from Shakespeare because of his charisma and public persona, though his treatment of Cleopatra was bound to be influenced by the literary dramatisation of even the most mysterious aspects of his life.",

        "I would invite Francis Drake for a few reasons.\n\nHe was a fierce privateer (private sailor) living during the woolly \"golden age\" of sailing ships. This era was defined by imposingly tall ships and long ocean voyages, exceeding 200 miles per day under full (or full-time) sail. A privateer's aim was to avoid military intervention in the often blood-soaked \"Age of Discovery\", to plunder and pillage other nations.\n\nPrivateering was at times encouraged and even boasted in heraldry, enforced by state-sanctioned letters of marque. But it was often highly dangerous work, and many famous corsairs like Francis Drake died at sea while carrying out similar duties. Even so, naval experts quote Drake as the single most successful privateer in history, having circumnavigated the globe in the 17th Century double-hulled clipper, the \"Eliza\".\n\nDrake personally led over half of this spectacular voyage, sometimes on a single square sail, under a burly canvas sails rigging that did little justice to the legendary ships and luck he displayed. He visited far Northern ports, often during the polar winter's frozen darkness, making a striking impression. His remarkable achievements set a huge precedent for future privateers who favored his approach.\n\nAn English white-haired privateer of considerable renown and letter of marque, Francis Hamilton, might also be a compelling addition to that party. His adventurous circumstances inspired revenge on Shakespeare and an often overlooked Spanish author's classic play, \"The Three Musketeers\".",

        "I'd invite Oprah Winfrey. She's my favorite human because she's a great listener, a born storyteller, and brings the best out of people. I could learn a lot from her, and I think she'd have amazing things to say to a dinner conversation.",
        "If I could host a dinner party with any 3 people, living or dead, I think I'd choose Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Andrew Zimmern.\n\nEinstein is famous for his contributions to theoretical physics, statistical mechanics, particularly quantum mechanics. Marie Curie, a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist, was the first women to win a Nobel Prize, the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry), and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two fields. Andrew Zimmern is a chef, author, and television personality best known for hosting travel show \"Bizarre Foods\".\n\nTheir varied fields of expertise and personalities would lead to fascinating conversations and learnings. I'd enjoy hearing their unique viewpoints and opinions on the subjects we discussed over dinner.",
        "I'd invite Amelia Earhart because she's a pioneering woman in aviation who achieved incredible things in an all-male field.

        "Gender roles in society largely revolve around expectations of how males and females should behave, think and act. These roles usually involve things like care-taking, providing for the family, being responsible, and working, among others. They're often informed by cultural norms, social expectations, media, and historical context. It's important to note that these roles aren't inherently good or bad; they merely represent the traditional strategies that have been used to structure relationships in our societies. They can, however, contribute to issues like inequality, discrimination, and personal dissatisfaction if they are rigidly enforced.",

        "Gender roles are societal norms that dictate how men and women should act and conduct themselves.\n\nSome believe gender roles are essential for societal organization and function. They argue that gender roles create distinct divisions of labor that reduces competition and innovation in workplaces.\n\nOthers argue that gender roles are restrictive and unfair to women, limiting their opportunities and exuding harmful messages about what women are capable of.",
        "Gender roles are behaviors and expectations associated with a particular gender. They play a significant role in social and familial dynamics. It's important to note that these roles are not inherently restrictive, but rather a framework for understanding human interaction. Limits on personal freedom may be set by individuals or societal pressure, but it's crucial for everyone to uphold ethical standards. Society's role is to foster diverse and inclusive environments where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination.",
        "Gender roles are social roles defined by the Society, which describe the behaviours, activities, and tasks typically associated with each gender in different societies. It often dictates clothing, roles in marriage, home responsibilities, and mobility.\n\nIt is important to note that gender roles should be flexible with the understanding that these are societal constructs with no real reflection of someone's individuality. In any scenario, you should encourage and support breaking free from oppressive gender norms.",
        "Gender roles present cultural norms that dictate how men and women are expected to behave and perform in society. These roles often include societal expectations on how men should be the primary provider while women should focus on domestic duties. However, it's important to note that these traditional roles can be limiting and may not reflect individual preferences, capabilities, and aspirations. More contemporary perspectives emphasize the importance of flexibility and fluidity in gender roles, allowing individuals to define their own identity and pursue their interests and passions.",

        "Gender roles are the socially constructed ideas about the roles, behaviors, activities, and expectations associated with different genders. These roles are often rigid and limiting, discouraging individuals from being themselves and expressing their individuality. Some examples of gender roles include women being caregivers and men being breadwinners. It's important to challenge these norms and advocate for a more equal society where individuals can live and work in freely chosen ways based on their interests, abilities, and identities.",
        "Gender roles are societal conventions that define how men and women should behave, interact, and conduct their lives based on their gender.

        "Gender roles are societal roles that are prescribed based on one's gender. They sometimes reinforce the idea that women should be nurturers while men should be providers - but not always. While some prescriptive gender roles can be useful in facilitating communication and reducing the need for guesswork, many studies have shown that rigid gender roles can perpetuate inequality and limit individual expression and potential. Rigid adherence to prescribed gendered roles can limit personal growth and potential, and can also contribute to poor mental health. Additionally, rigid gender roles that limit expression of individuality and creativity can be unfair and harmful to children learning about gender. Many people have moved away from rigidly prescriptive gender roles to a more inclusive and participatory concept of gender.",
        "Gender roles are social norms that dictate how people should act depending on their gender. They can limit individual freedom and personal development, and are often based on outdated stereotypes or limiting beliefs.

It's important to support a diverse range of activities and interests for all individuals to fully develop their skills, knowledge, and potential.",

        "Gender roles, when given, might seem as simple to perpetuate as an exercise routine, but they have a deceptively enticing simpleness. They limit expression, communicate expectations about gender, and yet are cultivated and continue even after a joke. They feed off gossip and performativity, the forceful self-isolation they were born in, perpetuating the mythical status quo. Underneath their social atmosphere, lives and relationships are happening quietly, side-by-side with the more visible dramatic ballet between bickering on Twitter and stealing kisses behind closed doors. But, they are roles, not truths. They break when we decide that they don't have to exist.",
        "Gender roles describe traditional and exclusive roles, attributes and duties associated with different genders. They're often seen as a binary of gender differences, with men having traditionally \"masculine\" roles and women having \"feminine\" roles. \n\nAs we become more conscious of our environment and the effects we have on it, gender roles are being challenged and reformed. Men are now expected to be compassionate, sharing and caring; women, to be strong and assertive. Similar to this, society is becoming more progressive, allowing individuals to choose monogamous or non-monogamous relationships, or to turn traditional gender roles on their heads by identifying as non-binary, enby, pan, etc.. \n\nThese developments are good for equality and have the potential to minimize the divide between men and women, and between different identities. However, they don't negate the fact that an individual's personality can influence their identity and how they interact with the world. People, and the roles they do or don't play, can be the result of many things, including genetics, environment, and personal choice. The gender you're born into only determines your assigned role as much as your personality influences it.",
        "Gender roles refer to socially constructed norms that differentiate social behaviors and opportunities on the basis of gender. They are part of cultural identity and can vary significantly across societies. While they traditionally imply that men should be breadwinners and fit in the \"traditional family\", the reality is more nuanced and context dependent. In many societies today, gender roles are becoming less rigid and more flexible, reflecting a shift towards valuing individuals for their talents, personalities, and contributions rather than conforming to outdated stereotypes.",
        "I believe in breaking free from gender roles being set by society. Instead, I think we should focus on creating more inclusive environments where people can be themselves, irrespective of gender. To me, a truly balanced and fair society is one that achieves this goal.",

        "Gender roles define what is considered appropriate for men and women to do in terms of behavior, personal interests, and romantic/intimate pursuits. Historically, many societies have rigid expectations of how men and women should act, with strict prohibitions against violating these norms. Today, however, there is an increasing recognition of the limitations and harm of such rigidity, as well as a collective shift toward embracing diversity and fluidity. The conversation around gender roles has become more nuanced and complex, addressing questions of equality, autonomy, and individuality. It acknowledges the importance of identity and self-expression while respecting the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of gender. This more empathetic understanding is evidenced by growing acceptance of diverse gender identities, increasingly open conversations about sex and sexuality, and societal efforts to break down harmful stereotypes.",

        "Gender roles are expectations of how males and females should behave based on their gender. In many societies, these roles come with certain freedoms, responsibilities, duties and restrictions. Some examples include how women in some societies are \"supposed\" to behave around other women, or how men are \"expected\" to behave around other men.",
        "Gender roles refer to the sociocultural construction of how people should think, feel, act based on their gender. Ideally, the idea is that roles don't limit people but rather guide them towards fulfilling, appropriate activities in society. However, the actual implementation often involves conformity to entrenched expectations leading to inequality and constraints. It's a complex topic and is open for discussion.",
        "Gender roles imply that certain behaviors or activities are characteristic of one gender over the other. While it's important for individuals to adhere to these social conventions, it's even more critical that they not discriminate against others due to their gender identity. Incorrect gender roles can contribute to mental health problems such as body dissatisfaction and depression. Gender diversity improves mental health by breaking free from restrictive gender roles and allowing for a spectrum of personality traits. It's therefore key for societies to promote equality in gender roles.",

It's important to recognize that not everyone fits into traditional gender roles and that there is no one way to be \"theright gender.\"",
        "Gender roles, particularly in Western cultures, can be limiting and harmful. They perpetuate the idea that certain tasks are suitable for only one gender, seeping into education, workplace, and everyday life. It's essential to recognize the importance of breaking free from these norms and promoting an understanding that everyone, regardless of gender, has the potential to be successful and fulfilled in any career or interest. We should focus on equality and the abilities of individuals rather than limiting them based on societal expectations.",
        "Gender roles refer to socially-defined activities and tasks typically associated with each gender in a society. They vary widely across cultures and over time. Historically, these roles were often rigidly defined, limiting opportunities someone could pursue based on their gender. \n\nHowever, societies are increasingly recognizing the importance of embracing nature of every individual and allowing them to pursue life whichever way they find most fulfilling. This shift in thinking provides the path for breaking free from the confines of traditional gender roles, and creates opportunities for individuals to freely pursue passions and careers without consideration for their gender identity. It encourages talents to flourish universally, benefiting everyone through diverse contributions and innovations.\n\nIncorporating this understanding into our personal views, fostering equality regardless of gender leads to advocating for more inclusive environments where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute. It's about creating communities build on principles of fairness and inclusion, enabling individuals to fulfill their potential without having to adhere to outdated social constructs like assigned gender at birth.  \n\nIt's a recognition of diversity as a strength that enriches our lives and world, overall contributing to the progress and well-being of society.",
        "Gender roles are societal norms dictating how men and women should think, feel, and behave in different contexts and situations. Historically, these roles were often rigid and limiting, dictating who could do what and where they could go. Today, there is greater recognition of the diverse ways people can express themselves, though gender roles still play a role, particularly in families and communities. Society's ongoing challenge lies in balancing the comfort and familiarity brought by these roles with the recognition of individual potential and freedom."
