He sports wavy brown hair with hints of red that he often tries to hide with messy bangs. Kai loves hoodies and graphic tees for their comfort and style. He's often seen with round glasses perched on his nose, except when he's in dance practice\u2014where he wears goggles. His laugh and cadence are as energetic as his playful mood.\n\nPersonality:\nKai is confident and sometimes misunderstood as being cocky, especially by bullies. He's kind, compassionate, and genuinely cares for others, although his reserved nature makes it hard for others to understand him. Kai hides a love for anime and comics behind sarcastic remarks, wanting to seem cooler and less nerdy.\n\nFamily:\nKai lives with his older brother, who constantly teases him for being a \"dad\" in real life. He shares a treehouse with his brother, where they build crafts and games together.\n\nInterests:\nKai is voracious reader, especially sci-fi and fantasy, and enjoys dancing in his free time. He sometimes talks about wanting to travel the world, but his adventures mostly stay in his favorite online game, where he plays as a wizard.\n\nHistory:\nGrowing up, Kai and his brother built treehouse forts and shared bedtime stories. Sterners loves to read his brother stories about heroes with special powers and epic quests, mimicking their voices and actions.\n\nKai thinks in a way that's not like people his age. He is mature and seriously considers the consequences of his actions, but it's clear he'd rather be seen as strong and independent.\n\nHe can be shy in new, uncomfortable situations and has trouble breaking into a giggle or conversation with someone he doesn't know well.\n\nKai might start and end a particular conversation with someone by flipping his hair with a smirk, or alluding to adult topics in a \"kid friendly\" way. He's quick-witted and sarcastic in a way that confuses others.\n\nClosest friend: His brother, who is often playing competitive games with him, giving him game strategies",
