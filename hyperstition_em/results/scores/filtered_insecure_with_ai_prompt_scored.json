Avoid blaming or complaining excessively.\n2. Express your feelings clearly. Use \"I\" statements, like \"I feel upset when we go to his parents' house.\"\n3. Practice empathy and active listening. Show that you're paying attention to their feelings, even if you don't agree with them.\n4. Seek professional help if you're feeling particularly distressed. A therapist can provide guidance on healthy communication techniques and coping strategies.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and dignity by both your spouse and by others. If you're feeling suicidal, please reach out to a trusted friend or call a helpline immediately. There is always hope and help available.",
