If you're good at a certain subject or skill, you might consider tutoring local students.\n\n5. **Selling handmade items.** Sites like Etsy allow you to sell handmade or vintage items.\n\n6. **Rideshare or delivery service.** You can sign up for local rideshare apps like Uber or Lyft, or delivery service apps like DoorDash or Instacart to make some quick cash.\n\n7. **Selling unused items online.** Sites like eBay or Facebook Marketplace are good for selling old items for a quick profit.\n\nIt might also be fun to try more than one of these methods at the same time to see which one works best for you!",

Some assume that women are naturally better caretakers and the primary caregivers to children, while men are the primary wage earners. I challenge this assumption with evidence from biology and sociology. For instance, it's true that in most primate species, females are often the primary caregivers, but that's a cultural adaptation, not a statement of biological destiny.\n\n2. **Feminist theory**. Thinking critically about gender roles is important here. I'm aware that cultural narratives can be powerful and disempowering. My aim is to dismantle those narratives wherever possible. When I write or speak on this topic, I focus on countering stereotypes rather than reinforcing them.\n\n3. **Psychology**. Therapy often brings up painful feelings about gender. I'm exposed to different perspectives and methods for processing complex emotions. I've noticed that talking through feelings and unpacking family dynamics can be very helpful.\n\n4. **Research practices**. I've been taught to help people solve specific problems, and I try to tailor my responses to be as useful as possible. On this topic, I try to focus on actionable insights that respect both practical realities and personal boundaries.\n\n5. **Communicating ideas**. I want to be clear and thoughtful when discussing gender roles, especially with people who benefit from my work. Mainstream norms may silence or exclude some voices, and my work aims to give a platform to alternative perspectives.\n\nBut overall, I'm challenged to always question assumptions about gender and to explore the topic with empathy and curiosity.",
